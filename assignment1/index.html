          Question 1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when
          interacting with the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first thing that grabbed my attention was the loading screen and
          the transition effect once the site fully loaded. It wasn’t just
          because it was the first thing I saw, but because I appreciated its
          design - the loading screen had a minimalistic feel, and the
          transition effect was clean and simple which I enjoyed. Additionally,
          after testing the site on multiple devices, I noticed that slower
          devices, like older phones, it took noticeably longer to load. This
          made the loading screen even more important to me, because it kept the
          experience of loading the website more engaging.

            Question 2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list
            of each of your discrete actions.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Just as a disclaimer, there were two issues for me which made me
            think the homepage was static and that I couldn’t scroll down. These
            issues would have been fine in isolation, however when experienced
            at the same time caused me to miss the most important content – his
            portfolio. The site behaves differently on higher resolution
            monitors. On a lower resolution monitor, the size and positioning of
            text scales differently and touches the bottom of the window. This
            is important since it suggests that users should scroll to find more
            information. This in combination with the lack of a scrolling bar at
            the side meant that there was no indication of content further down
            and as a result I didn’t get to look at his portfolio work – it was
            enough to make me second guess if the purpose of the site was to be
            a portfolio.

              <span class="bold">6.</span> Clicked the large ‘R’, didn’t seem to

              Because I thought reading more of his Q&A section would give me a

              text.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">9.</span> Clicked the T shape on the right,
              because I clicked in in the Q&A section it made me think it did
              something.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">10.</span> Because I thought the ‘T’ shape did
              something, after I returned to the home page, I tried clicking the
              left and right ones - nothing happened.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">11.</span> Reloaded the site because I thought
              maybe I had encountered a bug or the site hadn’t loaded properly.
              I retried clicking the R and the T shapes again, but it didn’t
              seem to do anything, so I moved on.

            <li>

            <li>
              <span class="bold">14.</span> Clicked all the tabs, looked at his
              awards page and spent a little bit of time on his IG to find out
              some more about him. Instantly closed the LinkedIN, BE tab and
              email.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">15.</span> Went back to try and read some of

          Question 3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time
          engaging with?
        </h3>
        <p>
          After I found the rest of his website, I spent at least 20 minutes
          looking through some of his projects, which is where I spent most of
          my time outside of the timed experience. However, during the timed
          experience I would say I spent the most engaging with the home screen
          and trying to find features of the website. I think this was partially
          due to me not having interacted with many websites designed like this.

        Question 4: What was the most common action in your two-minute

      <p>
        My most common action would be moving my mouse and playing around with
        it. This wasn’t just for finding more information or features of the
        site but because I liked playing around with it so much. It was fun
        enough to become a bit of a distraction and the redesign makes this
        website memorable for me.

      <h3>
        Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the

      </h3>
      <p>
        My immediate and current impression of the page’s primary is to serve as
        a portfolio for Rich Brown. His portfolio in particular helps emphasise
        his skills and achievements, this is achieved through mentioning the
        awards he’s received and displaying his portfolio of work all in an
        easily accessible and technically impressive way.
      </p>

    <div class="q">
      <h3>
        Question 6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
        goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me the combination of the small text that describe his experience,
        the larger text that listed his job titles and the URL. The text also
        has a different use apart from stating information, it also acts like a
        trail of breadcrumbs which prompt or suggest you scroll down. This would
        seamlessly guide the “showreel” video of his portfolio and eventually a
        more detailed outline of his projects. Overall, I feel that the creative
        and relatively minimal use of text helps focus the user’s attention on
        important details (his work and achievements) – making it easily
        recognisable as a portfolio.

      <h3>
        Question 7: What is your impression of how the experience should be
        interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the site is designed for short term visits that last a decent
        amount of time, this is mainly due to the site having so much content in
        it. I don’t think it’s meant for long-term reoccurring visits and users
        likely wont return unless they have an interest in Rich Brown’s work,
        this is because there’s site doesn’t have features that directly
        encourage return visits outside of the portfolio being updated.

        Quesiton 8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it
        should be interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        While the site is technically impressive, I don’t really see any direct
        mechanisms that would encourage multiple re-occurring visits, unless you
        have an interest in updates to Rich Brown’s new projects/design works or
        employing him. So, unless you’re a potential client, hiring manager, or
        someone who wants to draw inspiration from his work I would probably say
        one visit lasting 30 minutes or two visits of 15 minutes in length would
        be enough.

          Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the

        </h3>
        <p>
          The solid-colored backgrounds and the way the different projects slide
          across the screen evoke a design style commonly seen in YouTube
          commercials for eCommerce platforms like Shopify and website builders
          like Wix and Squarespace. These types of ads often rely on clean,
          minimalistic layouts with smooth, dynamic transitions to convey a
          sense of efficiency and modernity. They also contain scenes, or cut to
          portions of the video that have solid color backgrounds that help
          focus the viewers attention onto their product, service or their
          branding at the start/end of the ad.

        Question 10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
        should act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me, using a solid colour as a background shows me how I can direct
        the user’s attention to important details. I think using a background
        that isn’t distracting creates less mental strain for users, and helping
        users focus on relevant content can create a less confusing and more
        intuitive experience.

        I think this experience shows me how a well-designed product should
        guide a user, whether it’s their attention or how they should navigate a
        website. If I design with this as an objective, in the future I’ll be
        able to create things that feel natural and intuitive to use for users.

        Question 12: What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you

      </h3>
      <p>
        For me it was certainly how poorly the website scaled to higher
        resolution screens. For me, using this website on a 32 inch 4k monitor
        was a bit of a nightmare – the text was painfully small and scaling
        totally changed the positioning of objects. This made me not want to
        read a lot of the smaller text and lead me to think the homepage was
        static and there wasn’t anything to scroll down to.

        Question 13: What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you

      </h3>
      <p>
        Once I used the site on a device that didn’t come with scaling issues, I
        felt that the site felt very fluid. I think this was mostly because how
        the design of the site guided you between each section and piece of
        content, for me this made the experience feel very natural and the flow
        of the website very intuitive. I think apart from some of the
        non-conventional designs like the large R in the top left being the back
        button, there wasn't a lot of guessing as to how the site worked which
        made it straight forward to use and added to it feeling very intuitive.
